# Module 2

We are going to show here notes for Task 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to prove

Task 1
This task was executed by myself.

Description: Built a LED + Button circuit using a breadboard, current-limiting resistor, and an ESP8266 (D1 Mini). The goal was to control an LED using a button.
Outcome: Successfully assembled and tested the circuit, ensuring the LED lit up correctly when pressed. Learned about pull-up and pull-down resistors and how to prevent overcurrent damage to LEDs.
Task 2
This task was executed by my partner. The implementation was about relay-lock-button control, where a relay was used to switch a load based on button input.
It is documented here.

Task 3
This task was executed by myself.

Description: Worked on debugging breadboard wiring issues and identifying short circuits in our connections.
Outcome: Found that some of our internal breadboard tracks were faulty, causing unexpected circuit behavior. This was frustrating but a great learning experience in troubleshooting electronics.
Task 4
This task was executed by my partner. The implementation was about working with ESP8266 pin configurations and circuit layouts.
The documentation is available here.

Task 5
This task was executed by myself.

Description: Explored active high vs. active low logic in relay circuits and experimented with different pull-up/pull-down configurations.
Outcome: Understood how relay states (normally open vs. normally closed) affect circuit operation and improved confidence in schematic reading & debugging.
