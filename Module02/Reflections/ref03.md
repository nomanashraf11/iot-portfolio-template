Takeaway
I learned a lot about buses and communication protocols while facing some challenges with PlatformIO drivers, especially on my MacBook. The key lesson was to stay patient and ask for help when stuck. My biggest advice? Test things early and don’t let minor issues slow you down.

What Went Well
The lectures were clear, and the presentations—including mine on the CAT protocol—went smoothly. Completing two lab projects felt like a big win, and applying what I learned was the most rewarding part.

Challenges Faced
The biggest hurdle was dealing with PlatformIO driver issues and MacBook toggle problems. These took up a lot of time and slowed my progress on other lab projects. I realized that asking for help earlier could have saved me time.

Engaging Struggles
Even though the PlatformIO issues were frustrating, solving them felt like cracking a puzzle—difficult but satisfying. It reinforced the importance of troubleshooting skills and seeking help when needed.

Collaboration & Interaction
The interaction with peers and instructors was great. I received helpful feedback on my presentation and was able to assist a classmate with their PlatformIO setup, which felt good.

Extra Work & Contributions
While I didn’t do anything major like PR contributions, I still helped classmates in small ways. Their feedback and assistance, in turn, helped me navigate my own issues.

Mini-Project Progress
I successfully completed all the mini-projects, including:

Blinking an LED
Smooth fading using PWM
Reading analog values and building a voltmeter
Creating a touch interface with the MPR121 sensor
However, I didn’t get to the Bomb Defuse Challenge yet, but I plan to try it soon.

Final Thoughts
Overall, it was a productive session with a few technical setbacks, but I enjoyed the collaboration and hands-on experience. Looking forward to finishing the remaining lab work!
