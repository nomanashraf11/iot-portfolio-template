Reflection on Breadboards & Electronics Prototyping Lab
This workshop on circuit prototyping and breadboards was incredibly interactive and interesting. Working with simple parts like LEDs, buttons, resistors, and relays gave me a better understanding of how circuits are actually constructed and tested before a design is finalised.
Key Takeaways
For me, one of the most significant lessons learnt was the significance of appropriate wiring and connections while utilising a breadboard. The circuit itself was straightforward, but it took careful attention to detail to get everything to function properly. Working with buttons and relays taught me about pull-up and pull-down resistors as well as how active high versus active low logic alters component behaviour.
What Went Well?
constructed and tested two small projects successfully:
The LED + Button Circuit uses a resistor and a button to operate an LED.
Relay-Lock Circuit: investigating active high/low signals and switching a load via a relay.
learnt how to interpret schematics and layouts and gained a better knowledge of how ESP8266 pins function.
worked with a range of active and passive parts, including sensors, actuators, capacitors, and resistors.
Challenges & Struggles
However, things did not go as planned. When we first saw problems with our breadboard, we assumed that our wiring was incorrect, but it turns out that some of the internal connections weren't functioning correctly. We also ran into component shorts, which caused unexpected circuit behavior and made debugging tricky. This was frustrating at times, but also a good learning experience in troubleshooting electronics.
Fun Struggles & Exploration
Despite the difficulty of debugging, attempting to determine the cause of the circuit's malfunction was enjoyable. We had to replace parts, examine every connection, and reconsider our strategy a few times. It was also fascinating to learn about pull-up and pull-down resistors, as I had not previously given them much thought.
Collaboration & Help
Without a doubt, this was a collective effort. I collaborated with students to share insights, examine connections, and debug circuits. Additionally, the instructor provided insightful insights, particularly with regard to resistor values and relay behaviour. In the meantime, I assisted a few colleagues with wiring problems and ESP8266 pin configurations.
Final Thoughts
This was a fantastic workout all around. Despite a few technical difficulties, it was a worthwhile experience in problem-solving, circuit design, and prototyping. I now feel more comfortable dealing with microcontrollers, debugging circuits, and breadboarding.
