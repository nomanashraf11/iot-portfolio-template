# Reflection 1 in Module 1

- What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?
  Take-away can be small summary, but better outstanding points.
- What was good?
- What was difficult, where did you struggle?
- Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?
  Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors? 
- How was your interaction with peers/instructors?
- Help and extra work
  - Who helped you, gave feedback, was it valuable?
  - Who did you help, gave feedback to?
  - Did you present, implement, made a PR, or fix something that was crucial for the class in itself?
