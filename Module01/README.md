Module description

## Task Inspirations

- It was interesting have not interacted with Iot devices before so learning and seeing the magic was great
- Want to see how iot devices operate and work in ecosystem

## Task Personal Profile

- I have a background in web development related to java, database, microservices and typescript frameworks as well

## Task What is IoT

IoT (Internet of Things) refers to a network of interconnected devices that communicate and exchange data over the internet without requiring direct human intervention.

Domains and included areas:

-
-

Commonly used (data) protocols:

-MQTT

Typical devices (appliance or micro controller):

sticks/06/temp → A temperature sensor
sticks/02/temp → Another temperature sensor .
sticks/04/temp → A third temperature sensor.
sticks/06/button → A button (could be a physical IoT button for triggering events).
sticks/06/home → Could be a home automation device or a central controller.
sticks/06/console → Likely a monitoring/display device or a logging system.
sticks/06/# → A wildcard subscription

ESP8266, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, or Arduino

Challenges:

- Not any major
