Takeaways:
The class was an introduction to IoT, focusing on Node-RED, message queues, and device interaction.

It was hands-on and fun, involving a device with a button, message queues, and a console to view messages and temperature detection.

Teamwork was crucial. We formed a group of three and helped each other during the practice session.

What was good?
Team collaboration helped me understand concepts better.
Node-RED's visual flow-based programming made it easier to grasp message handling.

What was difficult?
Since it was the first class, understanding how everything connects in IoT might have been overwhelming.

Fun Struggles & Exploration
Figuring out how the message queue works and seeing messages pop up in the console was exciting.

Debugging why a button press didn’t trigger the expected message could have led to trial and error.

Showstoppers & reaching out for help
If setup/configuration issues occur, contact instructors.

Interaction with peers & instructors
Positive peer collaboration—helped each other understand concepts.

The instructor’s role was likely introductory, setting the stage for deeper IoT concepts in future classes.
